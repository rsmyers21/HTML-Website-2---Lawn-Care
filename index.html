      <h1>Lawncare With a Smile</h1>
      <p>At <strong>Reliable Lawncare</strong>, we offer a wide variety of lawncare services.
		Whether its mowing or bush trimming, we've got you covered. The next few lines are sample
    text in order to demonstrate the responsive nature of the website. They are simply meant
    to be purely filler as I artificially flesh out the content of this website. One fish,
    Two fish, Red fish, Blue fish, Black fish, Blue fish, Old fish, New fish. I Am Sam.
    I Am Sam. Sam I Am. That Sam-I-am! That Sam-I-Am! I Do Not Like That Sam-I-Am!
    Would you like green eggs and ham? I do not like them, Sam-I-Am. I Do not like green eggs and ham.
    Would you like them here or there? I would not like them here or there. I would not like
    them anywhere. I do not like green eggs and ham. I do not like them, Sam-I-Am.
    Would you like them in a house? Would you like then with a mouse? I do not like them in a house.
    I do not like them with a mouse. I do not like them here or there. I do not like them anywhere.
    I do not like green eggs and ham. I do not like them, Sam-I-Am. </p>

    <p> Would you eat them in a box? Would you eat them with a fox? Not in a box. Not with a fox.
      Not in a house. Not with a mouse. I would not like them here or there. I would not like
      them anywhere. I do not like green eggs and ham. I do not like them, Sam-I-Am. Would you? Could you? In a car?
      Eat them! Eat them! Here they are. I would not, could not, in a car. You may like them. You will see.
      You may like them in a tree! I would not, could not in a tree. Not in a car! You let me be.
      I do not like them in a box. I do not like them with a fox. I do not like them in a house.
      I do not like them with a mouse. I do not like them here or there. I do not like them anywhere.
      I do not like green eggs and ham. I do not like them, Sam-I-Am. *eats them* Say! I like green eggs and ham! I do!
      I like them, Sam-I-Am! And I would eat them in a boat. And I would eat them with a goat. And I will eat them, in the rain.
      And in the dark. And on a train. And in a car. And in a tree. They are so good, so good, you see!
      So I will eat them in a box. And I will eat them with a fox. And I will eat them in a house. And I will eat them with a mouse.
      And I will eat them here and there. Say! I will eat them anywhere! I do so like green eggs and ham!
      Thank you! Thank you, Sam-I-Am.</p>
